# men-as-promised
A fork of MEAN.JS, but without any AngularJS front-end and a lean towards using promises

MEN (mongodb, expressjs, nodejs) as-promised is designed to be a good starting point for an enterprise focused API. It's enterprise focused because the OAUTH stuff hasn't been tested and there is a concept of orgs and users. Creating an account creates an org and an admin user. That admin can then create other users with various roles to control API access.
